2. **Backend (Node.js with TypeScript):** Handles business logic, API requests, and integrates with external services.
3. **Authentication Module:** Manages OAuth, biometric login, and DID (Decentralized Identity).
4. **Blockchain Layer:** Integrates smart contracts and decentralized storage (IPFS) for data transparency.
5. **Environmental Module:** Tracks and reports carbon savings and environmental impact metrics.
6. **Analytics and Monitoring:** Uses Firebase Analytics and AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and insights.
